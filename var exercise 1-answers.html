<!-- 
    In this completed code:

We declared three variables num1, num2, and result using the var keyword and initialized num1 with 8 and num2 with 3.

We performed four arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using the num1 and num2 variables. The results of each operation are stored in result and then assigned to separate variables additionResult, subtractionResult, multiplicationResult, and divisionResult.

We displayed the results using console.log() to show the outcomes of the arithmetic operations in the browser's console.

When you open the HTML file in a web browser and inspect the console, it will display the results of the arithmetic operations with num1 = 8 and num2 = 3 as follows:

Addition: 11
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 24
Division: 2.6666666666666665

These are the results of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing the numbers 8 and 3.

  <p>Complete the following arithmetic operations and display the results:</p>

    // Step 1: Declare three variables using 'var' and name them num1, num2, and result.
    // Initialize num1 and num2 with any positive numbers of your choice.
    var num1 = 8;

    // Step 2: Perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using the variables.
    // Store the results in the 'result' variable for each operation.

    console.log('Multiplication:', multiplicationResult);
    console.log('Division:', divisionResult);
