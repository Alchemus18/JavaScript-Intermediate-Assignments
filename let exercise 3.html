<!--
    Your task is to complete the exercise by filling in the missing parts in Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, Step 4, and Step 5:

Step 1: Declare a variable birthYear using the let keyword and initialize it with your birth year (e.g., 1990).

Step 2: Declare a variable currentYear using the let keyword and initialize it with the current year. You can use the JavaScript Date object to get the current year.

Step 3: Calculate the age in years by subtracting birthYear from currentYear. Store the result in a new variable named ageInYears.

Step 4: Calculate the age in days by multiplying ageInYears by 365 (assuming no leap years). Store the result in a new variable named ageInDays.

Step 5: Display the age in days using console.log().

For example, your completed code might look like this:

let birthYear = 1990;
let currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
let ageInYears = currentYear - birthYear;
let ageInDays = ageInYears * 365;

console.log('Age in days:', ageInDays);
