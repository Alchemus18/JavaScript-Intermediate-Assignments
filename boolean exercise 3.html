<!--
In this simplified exercise:

We have a single HTML page with a heading and a div element with the ID "status" where we will display the open/closed status.

The JavaScript code includes the isRestaurantOpen() function to check if the restaurant is open based on the current time (hour). The function assumes the restaurant is open from 10 AM to 8 PM. You can customize this logic based on the actual opening hours of the restaurant.

The updateStatus() function gets the current hour, calls isRestaurantOpen() to determine if the restaurant is open or closed, and updates the content of the "status" div accordingly.

The updateStatus() function is called on page load to display the initial status.

When you open the HTML file in a web browser, it will display whether the restaurant is currently open or closed based on the current time.
