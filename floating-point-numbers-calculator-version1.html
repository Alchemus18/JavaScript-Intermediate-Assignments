<!--Look for the line that says var milesTravel = parseFloat(document.getElementById("miles-input").value); and replace the _____ with a variable name that represents the entered miles. This variable will store the value entered by the user.

Locate the line var hoursFly = _____ / 500.0; and replace the _____ with a variable name that represents the calculation for travel time when flying. This variable should be assigned the result of dividing the entered miles by 500.0.

Find the line var hoursDrive = _____ / 60.0; and replace the _____ with a variable name that represents the calculation for travel time when driving. This variable should be assigned the result of dividing the entered miles by 60.0.

Move to the line result.innerHTML = _____ + " miles would take:<br>"; and replace the _____ with a variable name that represents the entered miles. This will display the entered miles in the result section.

Look for the line result.innerHTML += " " + _____ + " hours to fly<br>"; and replace the _____ with a variable name that represents the travel time when flying. This will display the calculated travel time when flying in the result section.

Finally, find the line result.innerHTML += " " + _____ + " hours to drive<br>"; and replace the _____ with a variable name that represents the travel time when driving. This will display the calculated travel time when driving in the result section.
